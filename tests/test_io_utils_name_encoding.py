"""The temp-name byte budget is measured in the bytes the filesystem sees (#205).

`_cap_base_for_temp` exists so a destination basename near NAME_MAX does not
overflow the limit once the temp affixes are prepended. Its comment says the
budget is in bytes because NAME_MAX is a byte limit — true — and the old
implementation counted `str.encode("utf-8")` under the strict error handler,
which is a different set of bytes from the ones the kernel is handed.

The gap is reachable, not pedantic, because POSIX path bytes and `sys.argv`
both decode through `surrogateescape`: a byte that is not valid UTF-8 becomes a
lone surrogate in `U+DC80..U+DCFF`, which strict UTF-8 encoding refuses. So
`--out $'docs/savings\\xff'` made the cap raise `UnicodeEncodeError` before it
ever reached the length question.

`UnicodeEncodeError` is a `ValueError`, and no write seam in this repo catches
one. `bench_savings` and `tune_threshold` wrap their writes in `except OSError`
precisely so an unusable `--out` cannot escape `main` "as a raw traceback at
exit 1 — the 'success' range — *after* the bench already ran". A
surrogate-bearing stem walked past that arm and reproduced that exact failure.

These tests are written so the *host* never decides the verdict. The
`_cap_base_for_temp` cases are pure-function and hold everywhere. The seam
cases assert a property true on both a byte-transparent filesystem (ext4, where
the write succeeds) and a UTF-8-validating one (APFS, which returns `EILSEQ`).
